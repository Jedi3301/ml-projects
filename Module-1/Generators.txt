Good [morning/afternoon] everyone! My name is Jedidiah. im from vvit
I'm here to talk about a concept in Python called Generators.
it is helpful when you're dealing with large data or need to process things efficiently, and I’ll show you how.


Slide 2: What is a Generator?

So first, what exactly is a generator?

A generator is basically a function that yields values one at a time instead of returning them all at once.

It uses a special keyword called yield instead of return.

Let me show you a small example


def my_gen():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
"Now, when we call my_gen(), it doesn’t run the function immediately.
Instead, it gives us a generator object. We can then use next() to get each value, like this:"

gen = my_gen()
print(next(gen))  # 1
print(next(gen))  # 2

Each time we call next(), it resumes where it left off. So it remembers the last yield position!"




 3. Generator Expression

gen = (x * x for x in range(5))
🔍 Explanation:
"This is called a generator expression.
It looks like a list comprehension, but uses parentheses instead of brackets.
It doesn’t create the full list of squared numbers — it creates them one by one as needed."

🔹 How to use it:

print(next(gen))  # 0
print(next(gen))  # 1

🧠 When to use:
Say this when explaining:

"This is perfect when we just want to process elements one at a time, like filtering, squaring, or mapping over data."



Slide 3: Why Use Generators?

"So why should we use them?
Let’s say you have a list with millions of items — storing that in memory takes a lot of space.
Generators help avoid that because they don’t store all values — they produce one value at a time, only when needed."

"This makes them perfect for tasks like reading huge files, streaming data, or generating an infinite sequence — like Fibonacci numbers."

"Here’s a slightly more useful example — let’s say we want to count numbers up to a certain limit:"

def count_up_to(n):
    count = 1
    while count <= n:
        yield count
        count += 1

"If we call this with n = 3, it will yield 1, then 2, then 3 — but not all at once.
We can loop over it like this:"

for num in count_up_to(3):
    print(num)

"And it will print: 1, 2, 3."


 


Slide 6: Real-World Examples

"Alright, let's see some real-world use cases."

Example 1: Reading large files line by line

def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line

"This way, we’re not loading the whole file into memory -- just one line at a time."


Example 2: Infinite Fibonacci sequence

def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
"Here we’re generating numbers forever — and it still works fine because we’re only getting one at a time."

def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

"Here we’re generating numbers forever — and it still works fine because we’re only getting one at a time.

 


Slide 7: Generators vs Lists vs Iterators

"Quick comparison to wrap it up —
Lists store all values, so they use more memory.
Iterators can be customized with classes.
But generators? They give us the best of both worlds — lightweight and easy."




Slide 8: Conclusion

"So in summary:

Use generators when you need to process data efficiently.

They save memory and are easy to write.

Just remember: yield is the key!"



Slide 9: Q&A

"That’s it from my side! If you have any questions or want me to repeat a part, feel free to ask."
